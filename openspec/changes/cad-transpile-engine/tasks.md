# Tasks: CAD Transpile (thin, over the existing agent/LLM path)

Transpile is a translate-intent request over the existing system prompt
(`agent_language_reference`), LLM path (`llm.rs` + `Config`), version writing, and
verify gate. New code is limited to the translate instruction, two thin
affordances (code-window toggle, MCP convention), source adapters (extraction
only), and an optional dev CLI. Author tests first (BDD red→green) per task.

## 1. Translate instruction + message builder (pure, tested)

- [x] 1.1 (test) `build_transpile_messages(source, backend)` returns
  `(system, user)` where `system == agent_language_reference(backend)` and `user`
  contains both the fixed translate preamble and the source verbatim.
- [x] 1.2 Implement the builder + the fixed preamble (parametrize, loop-ify,
  "output only Ecky"). No model code here — pure string assembly.
- [x] 1.3 (test) preamble carries the semantic ask (params/loops) and forbids
  prose-only output; drift guard ties system prompt to `agent_prompt`.

## 2. LLM call (reuse, NIM-capable)

- [x] 2.1 Resolve provider/model/key/base_url from `Config` first, env override
  second (`NVIDIA_API_KEY`/`NIM_API_KEY`, `…_BASE_URL`, `…_MODEL`). Default
  base_url = NVIDIA NIM (`https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`). Evidence:
  `cad_transpile::tests::resolve_uses_selected_config_engine_then_documented_nim_environment_overrides`
  and `resolve_defaults_empty_configured_base_url_to_nvidia_nim`.
- [x] 2.2 Call via the existing OpenAI-compatible path (`send_openai_request` +
  `extract_openai_message_content`); do not add a second HTTP client. Evidence:
  `transpile_via_openai_compatible` accepts the shared client; payload shape is
  pinned by `cad_transpile::tests::transpile_payload_uses_openai_messages_with_the_resolved_model`.
- [x] 2.3 Strip any non-Ecky wrapping (code fences / prose) from the model reply
  before compile; (test) fenced and bare replies both yield clean source. Evidence:
  `cad_transpile::tests::strip_code_fence_handles_fenced_and_bare_replies` and
  `strip_code_fence_removes_leading_and_trailing_prose_around_ecky_model`.

## 3. Dev CLI (optional harness — model/provider comparison)

- [x] 3.1 Bin `cad_to_ecky <input> [--backend] [--model] [--base-url] [--out]`
  mirroring `translate_legacy_python_to_ecky_ir`'s arg shape. Evidence:
  `src-tauri/src/bin/cad_to_ecky.rs` parses every named argument;
  `cad_to_ecky_cli::{cli_flags_then_nvidia_then_nim_override_selected_engine_per_field,dump_prompt_respects_backend_flag,dump_prompt_rejects_invalid_arguments}`
  pins flag precedence, backend parsing, and invalid usage.
- [x] 3.2 `--dump-prompt` prints the assembled system+user with no API call
  (free inspection / diffing across models).
- [x] 3.3 (test) arg parsing + `--dump-prompt` output is deterministic and
  network-free.

## 4. Source adapters (extraction only; never emit Ecky)

- [x] 4.1 OpenSCAD `.scad`: pass-through text. (test) round-trips unchanged into
  the user message. Evidence: `cad_transpile::tests::openscad_adapter_preserves_source_bytes_in_the_transpile_user_message`
  pins CRLF, Unicode, comments, and trailing newline bytes through the adapter
  into `build_transpile_messages`.
- [x] 4.2 FreeCAD `.fcstd`: a fresh freecadcmd extractor that dumps the feature
  tree to JSON (extraction only — no Ecky emission). The JSON is the source text.
  Evidence: `cad_transpile::tests::fcstd_adapter_uses_fresh_freecadcmd_feature_tree_json_without_emitting_ecky`
  passes with fixture JSON and a fake command runner; no installed FreeCAD is required.
- [x] 4.3 STEP/BREP `.step`: textual summary (bodies, dims, key features) as
  source text. Faithfulness is then enforced by the parity gate, not the adapter.
  Evidence: `cad_transpile::tests::{step_adapter_summarizes_bodies_dimensions_and_features_without_ecky,brep_adapter_summarizes_topology_and_coordinate_extent_without_ecky}`
  pass against fixtures and prove no Ecky emission.
- [x] 4.4 Adapter dispatch by extension/sniff; unknown → treat as raw text.
  Evidence: `cad_to_ecky_cli::{dump_prompt_passes_unknown_extension_raw_text_verbatim,dump_prompt_preserves_unknown_extension_raw_decode_error}` proves an unknown extension carries CRLF/Unicode/trailing-newline source unchanged into `--dump-prompt`, without a fence, and preserves the raw `read input` UTF-8 error rather than using the OpenSCAD adapter.

## 5. Verify gate + repair loop

Checked items below record prior transpile behavior. Lossless-version-history
migration remains explicit in §5.5–§5.7.

### V1 (UI / consumer) — model + dialogue verify
- [x] 5.1 (prior behavior) After transpile, compile + render + `verify_generated_model` (structural
  + model-authored `(verify …)`) as normal; never auto-commit a red result.
  Evidence: `cad_transpile::tests::gate_compiles_renders_then_runs_existing_generated_model_verification`
  pins stage order and commit readiness; capped-red coverage pins false readiness.
- [x] 5.2 Dialogue-accrued verify: when the user states a requirement ("ears
  separate"), the model adds the matching `(verify …)` clause **with** the
  geometry change, so it persists as a check. Size/intent errors that pass
  structural checks are caught by the human in the loop, not by source parity.
  Evidence: `cad_transpile::tests::dialogue_requirements_accumulate_and_demand_matching_verify_clauses`
  and `dialogue_requirement_without_executed_authored_check_stays_red`.
- [x] 5.3 (prior behavior) Repair loop: feed the compiler/verify diagnostic back to the model (per
  the API operating contract) and re-request, capped; report capped red honestly
  without commit. Evidence:
  `cad_transpile::tests::compiler_diagnostic_drives_bounded_repair_then_green_verification`
  and `capped_red_verification_reports_diagnostic_and_never_becomes_commit_ready`.

### Internal CLI only (proving-ground, NOT the UI)
- [x] 5.4 Source parity: where the source is measurable, compare source bbox+volume
  (source → STEP/STL → `import_step`) to the rendered Ecky within tolerance;
  surface a mismatch as a parity diagnostic. Auto-catches size errors (the 2×
  head). Source-specific runtimes (freecadcmd, STL/STEP measurer) live behind the
  CLI; used to vet components before release. Do NOT wire into the UI. Evidence:
  `cad_transpile::tests::measurable_source_bbox_and_volume_mismatch_fail_internal_parity_gate`
  and `ui_tier_without_source_measurement_skips_parity`.

- [ ] 5.5 (BDD red) Append each distinct emitted/draft source before compile,
  render, or verify; prove invalid/pending output becomes head and unchanged
  observations do not duplicate versions.
- [ ] 5.6 (BDD red) Replace conflict/thread-advanced/force refusal with serialized
  append semantics; prove stale/concurrent emissions persist, last append is
  head, and late diagnostics attach to their originating version.
- [ ] 5.7 (BDD red) Store raw diagnostics on appended versions; add explicit
  successful/shippable filter/count separate from head/history. Repair outputs
  append new versions.

## 6. Surfaces

- [x] 6.1 Code window (V1 only): `translate to Ecky` toggle/action sends the
  current buffer as the source and replaces it with the result; keep the original
  recoverable on failure (no silent clobber of a good buffer). No FreeCAD or source
  parity in the UI. Evidence: `e2e/cad-transpile-code-window.spec.ts` proves the
  real-route happy, pending, and raw-provider-error flows; `cadTranspile.test.ts`
  pins verbatim source carriage into the existing authoring prompt.
- [x] 6.2 MCP: document the message convention (send foreign code + ask to
  transpile → agent writes a new thread version). Optionally add a thin
  `cad_transpile` verb that canonicalises the translate instruction; it must be
  pure sugar over the existing authoring flow. Evidence: authored convention in
  `skills/ecky-mcp/SKILL.md`; no new MCP tool or alternate authoring path added.

## 7. Optional: stdlib seeding consumer

- [x] 7.1 A transpiled + curated + verified model may go through
  `component_extract --save` like any other; no bespoke path. Stdlib's source of
  truth stays the hand-authored curated set (`language-convenience-stdlib`).
  Evidence: existing
  `mcp::server::tests::component_extract_tool_handler_extracts_and_saves_to_library`
  proves ordinary Ecky source extracts, saves, searches, and reads back through
  the shared component library path; transpile adds no component consumer.

## Migration note

The deterministic-emitter prototype and the library-survey script
(`scripts/freecad-transpiler/`) have been removed — their concept is dead. The
kill evidence (0% Array/expression/spreadsheet, 45% PartDesign over 97 mechanical
parts) is recorded in the proposal. The FreeCAD adapter (task 4.2) is built fresh
as extraction-only when needed; the LLM owns all Ecky emission.
