## First Solid: Ball on a Base

A renderable file needs a `model`, a named `part`, and geometry. Start with one primitive so each added transform or boolean has an obvious effect.

```scheme
(model
  (part marker
    (sphere 10)))
```

`model` is the root. `part` gives the geometry a stable id. `sphere` produces the solid.

Add another primitive with `union` when two solids should become one part.

```scheme
(model
  (part marker
    (union
      (box 28 28 4)
      (translate 0 0 10
        (sphere 10)))))
```

`box` makes the base. `translate` moves the ball up so it sits on the base instead of overlapping the center.

Use this pattern for first tests: primitive first, then one transform, then one boolean.

> **Watch for:** primitives start at the origin. Two untransformed solids overlap instead of stacking. If a union has the right members but the wrong silhouette, inspect placement before changing the boolean.
